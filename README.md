Built with [three.js](https://threejs.org/). Uses the example [EffectComposer](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_postprocessing) for Post Processing effects.

As of now dependencies are simply copied from `node_modules` to `gh-pages-lib` in the `postinstall` hook - best practice js bundling will come once this site is more complex!
